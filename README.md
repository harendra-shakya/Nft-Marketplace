Note: The Live server will not work as I deployed this project on Rinkeby testnet which does not exists anymore. But you can see the [Demo](https://portfolio-website-nine-dun.vercel.app/nft-marketplace).

I made a full stack demo nft marketplace, where you can buy NFTs, sell them, update their price and withdraw the money that you earned from selling NFTs.

Some tools which I used -
  - Hardhat
  - Ethers
  - Nextjs
  - Moralis
  - TheGraph
  - Web3 UI Kit
  - Tailwind
