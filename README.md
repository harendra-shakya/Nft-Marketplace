I made a full stack demo nft marketplace, where you can buy NFTs, sell them, update their price and withdraw the money that you earned from selling NFTs.

[Here's is the live server(Moralis Indexer)](https://nft-marketplace-three-delta.vercel.app/)

Note: Please use Rinkeby testnet.

Note: Moralis one might not be working because moralis shutdowns his cloud if I didn't login for 3 days, so try to use graph indexer one.

Some tools which I used -
  - Hardhat
  - Ethers
  - Nextjs
  - Moralis
  - TheGraph
  - Web3 UI Kit
  - Tailwind
